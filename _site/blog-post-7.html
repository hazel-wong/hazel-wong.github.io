                                            <p>7 OCT 2020</p>

                                            <p>This week, I had a one-hour interview with Adam Saltsman, a video game developer, from FINJI, where I got to learn a bit more about procedural generation. I also did some research on Brogue, a procedurally generated roguelike game, that he had recommended to look into during the interview. Finally, I began looking at the types of puzzle games there are to begin deciding what kind of puzzle game I could make for my final deliverable.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="subheading">Interview with Adam Saltsman</p>
                                            <p>The interview was very informative and really helped me understand what I was getting into. Here are some of the key things I took away from the interview:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>1. A lot of the times, developers use proc gen not to save time or costs, but to have access to something you cannot get access to through hand-authored levels. These random generated levels could give developers more complexity or an unpredictable element.</li>
                                                <li>2. In addition to creating a procedural generation algorithm, you will also need to write an algorithm to test and check your generated level. This could be to check whether it is even possible to solve the level or how many steps it is required to solve the level.</li>
                                                <li>3. For puzzle games, there are generally two forms of proc gen
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>• The level design is procedurally generated</li>
                                                        <li>• The ingredients (i.e. enemies, goals) are procedurally generated</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>
                                                <br>
                                                <li>There’s a big gap between hand-authored and randomly generated levels. The cost of using a proc gen algorithm when generating levels is that it is more difficult to incorporate style/design (e.g. if you want the level obstacles to make a certain shsape)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>He also gave me a few games that use proc gen that he thinks I could look into, one of which was Brogue, a roguelike game by Brian Walker, where players must try to descend down to the 26th level in a dungeon to retrieve an amulet before heading back up to the surface. I spent a few hours this week trying to understand the procedurally generated algorithm used in Brogue. A step-by-step description of the algorithm can be found from an <span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/28/how-do-roguelikes-generate-levels/#more-303483" target="_blank">interview</a></span> with the developer of the game.</p>

                                            <p class="subheading">The Procedurally Generated Algorithm in Brogue</p>
                                            <img width="700" src="images/blog/brogue.png"/>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="mb-0 devblog-white">Placing Rooms</p>
                                            <p>First, the algorithm places rooms in an empty grid at random. A single room is placed randomly on the grid, then the next room slides around the grid until it touches the edge of an existing room and has no overlaps with other rooms. Once the new room has been placed, a door is punched out. The algorithm repeats until there is no more space for new rooms. The rooms are randomly drawn as well. They could be a donut shape, a circle or a rectangle etc.</p>
                                            <p>Once the rooms are placed, the algorithm runs five rounds of smoothing on the rooms to ensure that the rooms have space in them and there aren’t any walls that are randomly connected. Every floor tile that has fewer than four adjacent floor tiles becomes a wall, and every wall tile with 6+ adjacent floor tiles becomes a floor tile. After the five rounds of smoothing, the biggest room is selected as the first room.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, the algorithm checks for wall tiles that have floor tiles on either sides and are a certain distance apart. For these tiles, the algorithm would punch a door to connect the two rooms.</p>
                                            <img width="700" src="images/blog/brogue-room.png"/>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="mb-0 devblog-white">Placing Lakes</p>
                                            <p>Randomly shaped lakes are generated and placed around the map, on top of the existing rooms. Using the same technique of sliding the lake across the map, the algorithm tries to find a place for the lake such that it does not block any paths. If a lake cannot be placed anywhere on the map, the algorithm tries again with a smaller lake.</p>
                                            <img width="700" src="images/blog/brogue-lake.png"/>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="mb-0 devblog-white">Placing Local Features</p>
                                            <p>Local features such as grass, crystals, mud pits, traps etc.are also placed at random. A random location is selected on the map and a local feature is spawned. The feature then randomly expands outwards based on probability. The further a tile is from the initial position, the lower the probability of the feature spawning on that tile.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mb-0 devblog-white">Placing Machines</p>
                                            <p>Brian Walker describes machines as “clusters of terrain features that relate to one another”. There are 71 hand-authored machines that determines where a machine should spawn in the level. This is the most complex part of the algorithm. I did not do too much research into this part of the algorithm, as I don’t believe my puzzle game will get to this complexity.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mb-0 devblog-white">Placing Items</p>
                                            <p>The algorithm for placing items is like a raffle. Each tile is assigned a particular number depending on where they are on the map. Every tile starts with a ticket. For each door that the player has to go through to get to the tile, the tile gets 3000 more tickets. For areas that the developers do not want items, such as hallways, the tile would discard all its tickets. When placing items, some tickets on the tiles around a specific tile with an item would be removed to discourage clumps of items.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mb-0 devblog-white">Placing Monster Hordes</p>
                                            <p>Monster Hordes are randomly and uniformly placed in lowest floor of a level.</p>
                                            <p class="mb-0 devblog-white">Takeaways</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Similar to what Adam Saltsman had said to me, Brian also agrees that procedurally generated levels cannot come close to hand-crafted levels designed by experts</li>
                                                <li>The procedural generation algorithm used in Brogue uses both forms of proc gen that Adam mentioned. Both the levels and the ingredients within the level are procedurally generated.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="subheading">Types of Puzzle Games</p>
                                            <p>Finally, I did some research on the types of puzzle games there are currently out in the market. A puzzle game is a game that requires solving a puzzle using problem-solving skills such as logic and pattern recognition. According to the Puzzle video game Wikipedia page, there are 6 different types of puzzle games.</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>1. Logical (e.g. Portal, Cut the Rope)</li>
                                                <li>2. Trial-and-Error / Exploration (e.g. Monument Valley)</li>
                                                <li>3. Hidden Object Game (e.g. Mystery Trackers)</li>
                                                <li>4. Reveal the picture game</li>
                                                <li>5. Tile-matching (e.g. Candy Crush Saga</li>
                                                <li>6. Traditional puzzle (e.g. Solitaire)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>The proc gen games I've looked at so far seem to fall under the logical and trial-and-error/exploration categories. So far, I've been most interested in creating simple games like Adrena Line and Streamline from my previous blog post, which I believe would fall under the logical category of puzzle games.</p>
