								<div class="left">
									<p>Hi! My name is Hazel. My aspiration of bringing ideas to life and optimizing performance has led me to complete my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. In Fall 2021, I will be pursuing a Master’s degree in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University.
										<br><br>
										Throughout my academic career, I have had software engineering and project coordinator work experiences. In the past few years, I have gained skills in frontend web development, game development and project management.
										<br><br>
										In addition, I am one of the co-founders of HardBoiled Studios, a game development team that is currently developing our debut game, Yolked. With our publisher Hitcents, we are aiming to publish the game on Steam and Nintendo Switch by 2022.
										<br><br>
										As a stationery-lover, I have also started a small enamel pin shop, Tiny Pocket Studio, on Etsy. I have been selling original designs of enamel pins, while occasionally marketing on Instagram and Reddit.
										<br><br>
										I also have an interest in music composition, singing and graphic design. I have composed various music pieces and designed graphics for Yolked and projects at work.

While Machine Learning algorithms have been deployed to calculate this risk, the racial fairness of these algorithms is unclear. Replicating prior work, we evaluate different definitions of fairness in this research project.

													<p>It has been estimated that the video game industry will be a $159.3 billion dollar industry in 2020, with estimations that it will exceed $200 billion by 2023 (Newzoo 2020) and $300 billion by 2025 (Forbes 2020). In addition, the world currently has 2.7 billion gamers, which is more than a third of the world’s population (Newzoo 2020). As the industry grows exponentially and is changing rapidly, it is important that we continue finding ways to improve and polish video games.</p>

													<p>Video game developers may often feel stuck when creating levels during development as there may be limited time, cost and memory. Procedural generation is a way for data in video games, such as levels, characters and the environment, to be created algorithmically. This method could have multiple advantages, including creating dynamic content, saving memory usage, saving development time and saving money (Packt 2016). This project attempts to explore that concept by creating an algorithm that will procedurally generate levels for a novel puzzle game, allowing more dynamic content to be created for people to enjoy while saving time, cost and memory usage.</p>

											<p>This week I looked at some random dungeon generation videos and tried implementing one of the algorithms on Unity. This algorithm is based on the room generation algorithm from Binding of Isaac and I picked it as I feel like it could be used for roguelike or puzzle games. I closely followed the video series this week on Unity, which included spawning rooms of the same dimension randomly. I also started brainstorming some mechanics that could be added into the game, which I will try to do next week.</p>
                                            <br><br>

                                            <p class="mb0">In this algorithm, there are three criteria:</p>
                                            <ul class="grey">
                                                <li>There must be a clear path between start and exit room</li>
                                                <li>The path must be closed (no openings leading to nowhere)</li>
                                                <li>There must be a start and exit room</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="mb0">Making a clear path:</p>
                                            <p>Each room is made of 10x10 pixels, with different room openings. For each opening, we put a “spawn point” 10 pixels away from the center, which will be the center point of the adjacent room.</p>
                                            <img src="img/blog/spawnpoint.png" width="300px"/>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p>I made a spawn function that uses randomization to create adjacent rooms. Rooms spawn depending on which door is open in the adjacent room, which is indicated by the spawn points. The algorithm puts all the different types of rooms into lists. For example, all rooms in the bottomRooms list would include rooms that have a top door. Then using Random.Range, the algorithm randomly selects a room to spawn adjacent to a room. Using a rigid body and a 2D collider, we also prevent rooms from spawning on top of each other. </p>
                                            <p class="mb0">Picking the Start and Last Room:</p>
                                            <p>The start room is the entry room, the only room that has 4 doors. The rooms are spawned in order using Invoke, which calls the spawning function every 0.1f. One by one, the algorithm adds the room onto the list and the last room added would be selected as the last room.</p>

                                                <li>The ice cube melts a little each move</li>
                                                <li>The levels are timed – it has to get to the end of the level before it melts</li>
                                                <li>The end goal could be a fridge, so that the ice cube can get back to its original shape</li>

											<p>This week, I had a one-hour interview with Adam Saltsman, a video game developer, from FINJI, where I got to learn a bit more about procedural generation. I also did some research on Brogue, a procedurally generated roguelike game, that he had recommended to look into during the interview. Finally, I began looking at the types of puzzle games there are to begin deciding what kind of puzzle game I could make for my final deliverable.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="bigger">Interview with Adam Saltsman</p>
                                            <p>The interview was very informative and really helped me understand what I was getting into. Here are some of the key things I took away from the interview:</p>
                                            <ol class="grey">
                                                <li>A lot of the times, developers use proc gen not to save time or costs, but to have access to something you cannot get access to through hand-authored levels. These random generated levels could give developers more complexity or an unpredictable element.</li>
                                                <li>In addition to creating a procedural generation algorithm, you will also need to write an algorithm to test and check your generated level. This could be to check whether it is even possible to solve the level or how many steps it is required to solve the level.</li>
                                                <li>For puzzle games, there are generally two forms of proc gen
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>The level design is procedurally generated</li>
                                                        <li>The ingredients (i.e. enemies, goals) are procedurally generated</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>There’s a big gap between hand-authored and randomly generated levels. The cost of using a proc gen algorithm when generating levels is that it is more difficult to incorporate style/design (e.g. if you want the level obstacles to make a certain shsape)</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>He also gave me a few games that use proc gen that he thinks I could look into, one of which was Brogue, a roguelike game by Brian Walker, where players must try to descend down to the 26th level in a dungeon to retrieve an amulet before heading back up to the surface. I spent a few hours this week trying to understand the procedurally generated algorithm used in Brogue. A step-by-step description of the algorithm can be found from an <span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/28/how-do-roguelikes-generate-levels/#more-303483" target="_blank">interview</a></span> with the developer of the game.</p>

                                            <p class="bigger">The Procedurally Generated Algorithm in Brogue</p>
                                            <img width="300px" src="img/blog/brogue.png"/>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="mb0">Placing Rooms:</p>
                                            <p>First, the algorithm places rooms in an empty grid at random. A single room is placed randomly on the grid, then the next room slides around the grid until it touches the edge of an existing room and has no overlaps with other rooms. Once the new room has been placed, a door is punched out. The algorithm repeats until there is no more space for new rooms. The rooms are randomly drawn as well. They could be a donut shape, a circle or a rectangle etc.</p>
                                            <p>Once the rooms are placed, the algorithm runs five rounds of smoothing on the rooms to ensure that the rooms have space in them and there aren’t any walls that are randomly connected. Every floor tile that has fewer than four adjacent floor tiles becomes a wall, and every wall tile with 6+ adjacent floor tiles becomes a floor tile. After the five rounds of smoothing, the biggest room is selected as the first room.</p>
                                            <p>Finally, the algorithm checks for wall tiles that have floor tiles on either sides and are a certain distance apart. For these tiles, the algorithm would punch a door to connect the two rooms.</p>
                                            <img width="300px" src="img/blog/brogue-room.png"/>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="mb0">Placing Lakes:</p>
                                            <p>Randomly shaped lakes are generated and placed around the map, on top of the existing rooms. Using the same technique of sliding the lake across the map, the algorithm tries to find a place for the lake such that it does not block any paths. If a lake cannot be placed anywhere on the map, the algorithm tries again with a smaller lake.</p>
                                            <img width="300px" src="img/blog/brogue-lake.png"/>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="mb0">Placing Local Features:</p>
                                            <p>Local features such as grass, crystals, mud pits, traps etc.are also placed at random. A random location is selected on the map and a local feature is spawned. The feature then randomly expands outwards based on probability. The further a tile is from the initial position, the lower the probability of the feature spawning on that tile.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mb0">Placing Machines:</p>
                                            <p>Brian Walker describes machines as “clusters of terrain features that relate to one another”. There are 71 hand-authored machines that determines where a machine should spawn in the level. This is the most complex part of the algorithm. I did not do too much research into this part of the algorithm, as I don’t believe my puzzle game will get to this complexity.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mb0">Placing Items:</p>
                                            <p>The algorithm for placing items is like a raffle. Each tile is assigned a particular number depending on where they are on the map. Every tile starts with a ticket. For each door that the player has to go through to get to the tile, the tile gets 3000 more tickets. For areas that the developers do not want items, such as hallways, the tile would discard all its tickets. When placing items, some tickets on the tiles around a specific tile with an item would be removed to discourage clumps of items.</p>
                                            
                                            <p class="mb0">Placing Monster Hordes:</p>
                                            <p>Monster Hordes are randomly and uniformly placed in lowest floor of a level.</p>
                                            <p class="mb0">Takeaways:</p>
                                            <ul class="grey">
                                                <li>Similar to what Adam Saltsman had said to me, Brian also agrees that procedurally generated levels cannot come close to hand-crafted levels designed by experts</li>
                                                <li>The procedural generation algorithm used in Brogue uses both forms of proc gen that Adam mentioned. Both the levels and the ingredients within the level are procedurally generated.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="bigger">Types of Puzzle Games</p>
                                            <p>Finally, I did some research on the types of puzzle games there are currently out in the market. A puzzle game is a game that requires solving a puzzle using problem-solving skills such as logic and pattern recognition. According to the Puzzle video game Wikipedia page, there are 6 different types of puzzle games.</p>
                                            <ol class="grey">
                                                <li>Logical (e.g. Portal, Cut the Rope)</li>
                                                <li>Trial-and-Error / Exploration (e.g. Monument Valley)</li>
                                                <li>Hidden Object Game (e.g. Mystery Trackers)</li>
                                                <li>Reveal the picture game</li>
                                                <li>Tile-matching (e.g. Candy Crush Saga</li>
                                                <li>Traditional puzzle (e.g. Solitaire)</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>The proc gen games I've looked at so far seem to fall under the logical and trial-and-error/exploration categories. So far, I've been most interested in creating simple games like Adrena Line and Streamline from my previous blog post, which I believe would fall under the logical category of puzzle games.</p>

											<p>This week, I looked into the procedural generation algorithm for levels in Spelunky and four other puzzle games that also use procedural generation to create levels.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="bigger">Spelunky</p>
                                            <p>Spelunky is a platformer, action-adventure game, where the goal of the game is to collect as much treasure as possible. The game uses a procedural generation to create each cave level.</p>
                                            <!-- <p class="devblog-white mb0">Procedural Generation Algorithm Summarized:</p> -->
                                            <p class="mb0"><b>Part 1: Generating a Solution Path</b></p>
                                            <p>The algorithm to generate cave levels is split into two parts. The first is to generate the solution path. Each cave level is split into 16 rooms and each room is categorized into one of four types.</p>
                                            <ul class="grey">
                                                <li>A type 0 room is a side room that is not on the solution path</li>
                                                <li>A type 1 room is guaranteed to have left and right exits</li>
                                                <li>A type 2 room is guaranteed to have left, right, bottom exits (If there is another 2 room above, then it also has a top exit)</li>
                                                <li>A type 3 room is guaranteed to have left, right and top exits</li>
                                            </ul>
											<br>
                                            <p>The algorithm starts by placing a type 1 room on the top row. Then a random number generator picks a number from 1-5 whether the solution goes left, right or bottom. A 1 or 2 means the solution moves left, 3 or 4 means right, and 5 means bottom. If a 5 is chosen, then the room type of the starting room changes to a type 2. In the next room, the algorithm determines whether the previous room was a type 2. If it is then the current room is either a type 2 or 3, as the current room has to have a top exit. The algorithm then starts over until the solution path reaches the bottom row. If the solution path wants to drop down at the bottom row, then the final room is simply placed instead. Finally, type 0 rooms are placed on the cells that are not part of the solution path.</p>

                                            <p class="mb0"><b>Part 2: Creating Individual Rooms</b></p>
                                            <p>After a solution path has been found, the individual rooms are created using room templates, which are manually created. Each type of room has a specific room template. A template looks like a 2D 10x8 array with a number or letter in each cell. Each number or letter represents different things. The algorithm places obstacles, blocks and empty spaces based on the label of each cell.</p>

                                            <p>As there are a variety of different puzzle games, it is understandable that there isn't one specific procedural generation algorithm that can be used to create levels for each puzzle game. However, there seems to be a pattern emerging. It seems to be the case that levels are created using a broad-to-narrow approach. For example, starting with the outer walls, then adding start/goal positions for mazes, or starting finding the solution path first, before creating individual rooms for Spelunky.</p>

											<p>This week, I contacted five stakeholders to ask whether it would be possible to conduct interviews to learn more about procedural generation in video games. In addition, I started experimenting with my research idea by simplifying my research problem. I looked at procedural generating levels for the simplest puzzle game I could think of, mazes. I followed a tutorial that procedurally generated maze levels algorithmically and used the generated data to create meshes for the level. Through this tutorial, I was able to learn how to implement a simple procedural generation algorithm and represent it visually on Unity.</p>

                                            <p class="bigger">The Tutorial</h4>
                                            <p>The tutorial starts off by providing a Unity starter package that includes:</p>
                                            <ul class="grey">
                                                <li>two C# scripts, a simple player movement script and a trigger handler script</li>
                                                <li>a scene with a player, a spotlight, a camera and UI for score and time</li>
                                                <li>a graphics folder with materials for the maze wall, ceiling and floor</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <p>The tutorial walked me through how to write a GameController script that handles the overall game, a MazeConstructor script that manages the generation of mazes, a MazeDataGenerator script that initializes the maze, and a MazeMeshGenerator script that creates meshes for the maze from the maze data. </p>
                                            <p>Essentially, the flow of the program is as follows: the developer specifies dimensions for the maze in MazeDataGenerator. Then using a maze generation algorithm, MazeDataGenerator generates a random maze in the form of a 2D array. The MazeConstructor then iterates through the 2D array, adding start and goal positions algorithmically. Then MazeMeshGenerator is called in MazeConstructor to add meshes to the maze based on the 2D array. Finally, the GameController creates the maze on Unity.</p>

                                            <!-- <br> -->
                                            <p class="devblog-white mb0">Maze Paths:</p>
                                            <p>The maze generation algorithm is written in MazeDataGenerator and is given the size of the 2D array as inputs. It is a simple algorithm that has two nested for loops to iterate through the cells in the array. A “0” or “1” is assigned to a cell to represent whether a cell is open or blocked, respectively.</p>
                                            <p>The algorithm starts at the first cell of the array at (0,0). First, the algorithm checks whether a cell is on the edge of the maze. If the cell is on the edge, then it is assigned a 1. Then the algorithm iterates through every other cell, by checking whether the cell is even or odd. If the cell is odd, then it is assigned a 0. If the cell is even, the algorithm randomly generates a value. If the value is above a certain threshold, then the cell is assigned a 0, otherwise it’s assigned a 1. Rather than just simply adding a wall to every other cell, the generation of a random value is to encourage open spaces in the maze rather than having it filled with tight corridors. Finally, once a cell is assigned a 1, the algorithm randomly selects an adjacent cell and assigns a 1 to that cell as well.</p>
                                            <!-- <br> -->
                                            <p class="devblog-white mb0">Adding Start and Goal Positions:</p>
                                            <p>Once the maze has been generated, the algorithm goes through the 2D array again to add start and goal positions. To add a start position, the algorithm starts at (0,0) and iterates through each cell in the array until it finds an empty cell. Similarly, to add a finish position, the algorithm starts at the max value and iterates through each cell in the array backwards until it finds an empty cell.</p>

                                            <p>The final steps of the tutorial involves creating meshes for wall, ceiling, floor, the start position and the goal position based on the 2D array, incrementing the score once a goal has been found and starting a new maze once the timer runs out. Once I completed the tutorial, I built the game as a WebGL and uploaded it online.</p>

                                            <p>This tutorial was able to show me how to create simple mazes using a basic procedural generation algorithm and how to incorporate them into a video game by representing them visually on Unity. This tutorial had boosted my confidence in my research idea as it gave me an idea of how to possibly structure my code for my own puzzle game. It also made me less overwhelmed by my research idea as I now realize that procedural generation algorithms could be relatively simple depending on the scope of the game.</p>

                                            <p>As this tutorial was rather simple, my next steps would be to look at more complex procedural generation algorithms and begin brainstorming ideas for a novel puzzle game.</p>

                                            <p>Game developers, especially those who are developing puzzle games, would benefit the most from my results. Generally, game developers work in game development studios, where they code the base engine of video games, generate levels for video games and translate ideas discussed in meetings into code. Oftentimes, they may be faced with optimization, time, cost  or memory issues which could be fixed with procedurally generating levels. Being able to efficiently generate solvable levels could be important to game developers as it could save development time. money and memory usage. Resources that developers tend to have at their disposal are a decently sized team of developers and game development technology.</p>

                                            <a href="http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/~sdubnov/Mu270d/AIIDE12/01/AIIDE12-040.pdf">1. The Gold Standard: Automatically Generating Puzzle Game Levels</a><br/>
                                            <p>This paper introduces an automatic level generation system called Goldspinner for a non-scrolling puzzle platform game, KGoldrunner. Goldspinner is able to create interesting solvable levels that are both statically good and dynamically good by running (1) a genetic algorithm to generate and evaluate candidate levels and (2) simulations of these good candidate levels to test its dynamic aspects.</p>
                                            <p>To create a new level, the genetic algorithm starts with an initial base level, then overlays features, such as walls, on it. Once a level has been created, an evaluation function is used to determine whether a hero can travel through the level. A level is separated into different nodes. Each time the hero can travel between a pair of nodes, an edge is added to a graph called a “group graph”, which shows the possible movements of the hero in the level. If a level passes the static tests, Goldspinner then performs simulations to determine whether a level is actually solvable. A plan to complete the level is generated and an AI attempts to follow the plan. If the AI player is able to reach the exit, then the level is considered solvable and also encompasses desirable static and dynamic properties.</p>
                                            <p>Although Goldspinner is applied solely to KGoldrunner, it is possible that the technique can be used for other puzzle games.</p>

                                            <p>In this paper, an algorithm is used to procedurally generate levels for the Japanese puzzle game, Sokoban. Sokoban is a simple puzzle game, where the player has to push boxes onto specific squares specified in the level. However, the player is restricted by the placement of walls, different boxes, as well as its ability to only push one box at a time. The method used to procedurally generate levels for Sokoban is by working backwards. The algorithm itself consists of three steps: (1) Build an empty room; (2) Place goals in the room; (3) Find the state farthest from the goal state.</p>
                                            <p>First, an empty room is built by randomly selecting the height and width of the level, then walls and floors are added, while making sure that none of the rules are violated. Next, the goal is placed using brute force. Then, the algorithm finds the farthest state from the goal state and returns the set of levels that are furthest from the goal state. Finally, it filters these levels to find the best candidate levels that are not too easy or too similar to previous levels.</p>
                                            
                                            <a href="https://www.cs.umn.edu/sites/cs.umn.edu/files/tech_reports/16-005.pdf">3. Generating Sokoban Puzzle Game Levels with Monte Carlo Tree Search</a><br/>
                                            <p>This is another paper that attempts to procedurally generate levels for the Japanese puzzle game, Sokoban. The approach it uses is a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based approach that guarantees solvability, efficiency and speed by simulating gameplay. The algorithm is not require any human designed input and is able to generate levels of various sizes. </p>
                                            <p>MCTS is a search algorithm that consists of four distinct phases: selection, expansion, rollout and backpropagation. The reason why MCTS is used is because of its anytime property and its ability to succeed in problem that have large branching factors. The approach used in the article separates the puzzle program into two: puzzle initialization (where to place the starting locations of boxes, empty tiles and obstacle tiles) and puzzle shuffling (where to place goal locations). MCTS is then used to optimize the solutions. An evaluation function is used to filter out levels that are too easy or uninteresting, leaving a set of challenging and solvable puzzles. </p>

                                            <p>Procedural generation is a way for data in video games, such as levels, characters and the environment, to be created algorithmically. This method could have multiple advantages, including creating dynamic content, saving memory usage, saving development time and saving money (Packt 2016). This project will attempt to explore that concept by creating an algorithm that will procedurally generate levels for a novel puzzle game, allowing more dynamic content to be created for people to enjoy while saving time, cost and memory usage.</p>
