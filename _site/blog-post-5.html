                                            <p>This week, I contacted five stakeholders to ask whether it would be possible to conduct interviews to learn more about procedural generation in video games. In addition, I started experimenting with my research idea by simplifying my research problem. I looked at procedural generating levels for the simplest puzzle game I could think of, mazes. I followed a tutorial that procedurally generated maze levels algorithmically and used the generated data to create meshes for the level. Through this tutorial, I was able to learn how to implement a simple procedural generation algorithm and represent it visually on Unity.</p>

                                            <p class="subheading">The Tutorial</h4>
                                            <p>The tutorial starts off by providing a Unity starter package that includes:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> • two C# scripts, a simple player movement script and a trigger handler script</li>
                                                <li> • a scene with a player, a spotlight, a camera and UI for score and time</li>
                                                <li> • a graphics folder with materials for the maze wall, ceiling and floor</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <p>The tutorial walked me through how to write a GameController script that handles the overall game, a MazeConstructor script that manages the generation of mazes, a MazeDataGenerator script that initializes the maze, and a MazeMeshGenerator script that creates meshes for the maze from the maze data. </p>
                                            <p>Essentially, the flow of the program is as follows: the developer specifies dimensions for the maze in MazeDataGenerator. Then using a maze generation algorithm, MazeDataGenerator generates a random maze in the form of a 2D array. The MazeConstructor then iterates through the 2D array, adding start and goal positions algorithmically. Then MazeMeshGenerator is called in MazeConstructor to add meshes to the maze based on the 2D array. Finally, the GameController creates the maze on Unity.</p>

                                            <p class="subheading">The Maze Generation Algorithm</p>
                                            <!-- <br> -->
                                            <p class="devblog-white mb-0">Maze Paths</p>
                                            <p>The maze generation algorithm is written in MazeDataGenerator and is given the size of the 2D array as inputs. It is a simple algorithm that has two nested for loops to iterate through the cells in the array. A “0” or “1” is assigned to a cell to represent whether a cell is open or blocked, respectively.</p>
                                            <p>The algorithm starts at the first cell of the array at (0,0). First, the algorithm checks whether a cell is on the edge of the maze. If the cell is on the edge, then it is assigned a 1. Then the algorithm iterates through every other cell, by checking whether the cell is even or odd. If the cell is odd, then it is assigned a 0. If the cell is even, the algorithm randomly generates a value. If the value is above a certain threshold, then the cell is assigned a 0, otherwise it’s assigned a 1. Rather than just simply adding a wall to every other cell, the generation of a random value is to encourage open spaces in the maze rather than having it filled with tight corridors. Finally, once a cell is assigned a 1, the algorithm randomly selects an adjacent cell and assigns a 1 to that cell as well.</p>
                                            <!-- <br> -->
                                            <p class="devblog-white mb-0">Adding Start and Goal Positions</p>
                                            <p>Once the maze has been generated, the algorithm goes through the 2D array again to add start and goal positions. To add a start position, the algorithm starts at (0,0) and iterates through each cell in the array until it finds an empty cell. Similarly, to add a finish position, the algorithm starts at the max value and iterates through each cell in the array backwards until it finds an empty cell.</p>
                                            <!-- <br> -->
                                            <p class="devblog-white mb-0">Finishing Touches</p>
                                            <p>The final steps of the tutorial involves creating meshes for wall, ceiling, floor, the start position and the goal position based on the 2D array, incrementing the score once a goal has been found and starting a new maze once the timer runs out. Once I completed the tutorial, I built the game as a WebGL and uploaded it online.</p>

                                            <p>This tutorial was able to show me how to create simple mazes using a basic procedural generation algorithm and how to incorporate them into a video game by representing them visually on Unity. This tutorial had boosted my confidence in my research idea as it gave me an idea of how to possibly structure my code for my own puzzle game. It also made me less overwhelmed by my research idea as I now realize that procedural generation algorithms could be relatively simple depending on the scope of the game.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <p class="subheading">Next Steps</p>
                                            <p>As this tutorial was rather simple, my next steps would be to look at more complex procedural generation algorithms and begin brainstorming ideas for a novel puzzle game.</p>
